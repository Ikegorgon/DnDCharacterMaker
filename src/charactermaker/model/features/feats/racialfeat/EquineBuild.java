In addition, any climb that requires hands and feet is especially difficult for you because of your hooves, so each foot of movement costs you 4 extra feet instead of the normal 1. Finally, a Medium or smaller creature can ride on your equine back if you allow it. In such a situation, you continue to act independently, not as a controlled mount.");
