You perform a special alchemical procedure on one object composed entirely of wood, stone (but not a gemstone), iron, copper, or silver, transforming it into a different one of those materials. For each 10 minutes you spend performing the procedure, you can transform up to 30 litres of material. After 1 hour, or until you lose your concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell), the material reverts to its original substance.");
