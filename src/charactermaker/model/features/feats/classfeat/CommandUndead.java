As an action, you can choose one undead that you can see within 60 feet of you. That creature must make a Charisma saving throw against your wizard spell save DC. If it succeeds, you canâ€™t use this feature on it again. If it fails, it becomes friendly to you and obeys your commands until you use this feature again.\n" +
